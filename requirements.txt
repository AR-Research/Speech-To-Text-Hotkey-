# For offline STT with CMU Sphinx:
# On Windows, 'pip install pocketsphinx' can be tricky.
# Try 'pip install pocketsphinx-binary' if available for your Python version/platform.
# Alternatively, ensure you have C++ build tools and SWIG installed if building from source.
# pocketsphinx-binary 
# OR if you build pocketsphinx from source, list its direct requirements if any not covered.
# If pocketsphinx-binary is not used, users may need to install pocketsphinx manually.
# PyAudio is often a dependency of SpeechRecognition, but sounddevice is handling mic input.
# However, SpeechRecognition might still use it for AudioFile processing or if its own mic functions were used.
# Including it to be safe, but it might be omittable if no issues arise.
